# Hello, I'm Zbe!

### Who am I?

I am a developer who enjoys creating apps and solutions for random challenges.

### What do I do?

I work as a full stack developer, and in my free time, I enjoy developing solutions for problems that I come across.

### When do I do that?

Whenever I have some free time, I love diving into different projects and playing around with various technologies and frameworks. The thing is, I tend to start a bunch of random stuff but rarely finish them. Still, I find it exciting to learn new things while working on these projects.

### What are your projects?

I mostly work on personal projects that I don't make public. However, the ones I do release are usually at least (almost) complete. I also enjoy tinkering with Linux, so a lot of my random projects involve Linux server or desktop tools.

### Want to work together?

If you're interested in working together on a project or just want to chat, feel free to hit me up at [info@zbejas.io](mailto:info@zbejas.io)!
